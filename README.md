# RTCMemoryVS
basically an addon board for some other projects to have an external battery for the RTC or anything else that needs to have a voltage to maintain memory. 

Vin max - 14Cancel changes

Battery max voltage - 3.6 

Output Votlage - 3.3 

Max Current - 500mA but should only do about 100-250mA  

using a MAX6326 and a switching voltage regulator to supply 3.3 voltage to maintain a RTC or other electrical devices with a battery or from an always on votlage source.
